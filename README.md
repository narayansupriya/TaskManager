# TaskManager
Task manager for an overwhelmed user who cannot decide which task to complete but knows how much time is available before stopping to do something else.

Here, the user can pass a list of tasks to be completed and the time it takes for each task in minutes. Next, when the user passes the duration available to spend for doing a task, the program returns a random task that can be completed if it can be completed in the said time.
